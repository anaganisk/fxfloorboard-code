GT-6BFxFloorBoard version 20090729: 29 July 2009

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DONATE, YOU MAY FREELY USE THIS SOFTWARE, 
 JUST KEEP IN MIND THE 6000 HOURS SPENT OVER 4 YEARS GETTING IT HERE,
 SO FAR WITH LITTLE REWARD. I WOULD LOVE A BEER!!!.

******** USEFUL INFORMATION *************
 
a.) Connect the GT-6B via a Midi device.

b.) Start the FxFloorBoard program, for the Menu select Preferences/Midi and select the midi device for midi input and output.

c.) Select the editor program "Bulk Mode" button, it should stay "on" if all connections are correct, the GT-6B must be set to bulk mode too.

d.) Open the Patch-Tree side panel by clicking your mouse pointer on the 'yellow arrow', the Patch-Tree has items which will expand when you click on the [+] symbols.
 When the tree items expand, you will see the patch names appear as the editor requests this information from the GT-6B.

e.) A single mouse pointer click on the Patch-Tree name will change the GT-6B to that selected patch only - sound played through the GT-6B will have the sound of that patch.
 
f.) A double click on the patch name will load the patch information from the Gt-6B into the editor, all the patch settings will update the editor GUI.

g.) Exit Bulk Mode on both GT & editor. Any knob turning will change the sound of the effect being adjusted, when the desired sound is achieved, you can either save the patch to the GT-6B or save the patch to file on disk.

h.) To save the patch to the GT-6B press the "write/sync" button, while set to Bulk Mode.

GT-6B-FxFloorBoard: 
NOTE: THIS IS AN UNPAID PROJECT, SO FAR INVESTING OVER 6000 HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 4 YEARS, I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY, BUT SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT. 

saved files will now produce %100 GT-6B accurate files. files can be saved/loaded as syx type.
The GT10BFxFloorBoard version will also open GT-6B files.


This project is a continuing session of evolution.

patch renaming is done by doubleclicking name display panel and entering the required text.

CUSTOM INIT PATCHES HOW-TO:
---------------------------

1. Create a patch save it as .syx or .syx2.

2. Put the file in this directory.

3. Restart the application.

4. Done!


Note: By default your patch will appear at the bottom of the
      [Init Patches] pull down menu with (My INIT) prepended 
      to it for your convenience.

      When this is not desired do the following:
      ------------------------------------------

      When omitting INIT_ in the patch name the patch will be 
      displayed with (My INIT) prepended to the filename. So 
      to circumvent this add INIT_ to the filename. 

      To change the order of files put xxx_ in front of the 
      filename, where x is a number to control the order it 
      will appear in the "[Init Patches]" pull down menu.
      
      Underscores will be replaced by spaces and "-!-" by "/".
      Because AC/DC is not ACDC, neither AC_DC or AC-DC.

      Possible filenames: 001_INIT_YourFileName.syx
                          002_YourFileName.syx
                          INIT_YourFileName.syx
                          YourFileName.syx
