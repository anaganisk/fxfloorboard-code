GT-3FxFloorBoard: 
NOTE: THIS IS AN UNPAID PROJECT, SO FAR INVESTING OVER 7000 HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 3 YEARS, I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY, BUT SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT. 

SYSTEM EDITING added, assigns added, now uses Qt library version 4.5.1

This project is a continuing session of evolution.

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected in Bulk Mode' button active), double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected'). 

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.
