************GT-10FxFloorBoard beta version: 28 January 2009 *************************


****NOTE: SOME FEATURES MAY HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMPLIMENTED, 
	OR SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT.****PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS AN ERROR!! 

****************************************************************************************
*        VERY IMPORTAINT !!! SYSTEM SETTINGS ADJUSTMENTS REMAIN AS THEY ARE SET,       *
*         BE CAREFUL WHEN ADJUSTING SYSTEM SETTINGS, SAVE SYSTEM SETTINGS FIRST !!     * ****************************************************************************************



a.)  The Chain concept is now implemented, conditional placement and auto sorting of A/B 
        path items.
	 
b.)  Assigns 1-8 have now been included.

c.)  Layout increased to fit 18 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions.
		 (i use 1280 X 800) does this fit on your screen?

d.)  Continuing sessions at building this GT-10 version, most items are listed,
	with exception of the System & Quick FX data area.

e.)  Patch-tree items in the sidepanel to the left side, patch change with a mouse left 
        single-click and (when 'connected' button active), double clicking the tree patch 
        item will request a patch transfer from the GT-10.
	opening each patch-tree bank node will request patch names (while 'connected') and 
        update the list. 

f.)  Patch rename by double-clicking name display panel (top display with patch name in it).

g.)  GT-8 patch conversion. Gt-8 patches can be opened and saved as GT-10 patches. 
	SMF file type support added, files are compatable with Boss Librarian SMF 
        files (single patch).



****my wish list**** (things i would like to know, *help needed please*): 

  1.)  ***Suggestions on features or improvements are welcome.
      

  2.)  ***check GT-8 patch convertion matches GT-10 equivilent values.
	if anyone has some preferences on better conversion ideas (i.e. matching preamps differently)

**IMPORTAINT !! ** If you find any errors or issues, most likely i don't know about them  
		(i don't have a GT-8 for patch conversion testing),
 		and i am relying on you to let me know.
