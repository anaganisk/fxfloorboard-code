GT-FxFloorBoard Preview version: 28 may 2008

NOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW VERSION AND MANY FEATURES HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMPLIMENTED, OR SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT. 
yet to sort chain structure concept. chain will currently place all FX into channel A path.
try out all the pedals by double or right click on stomp body, let me know which parameters are incorrect.

saved files will not produce %100 GT10 accurate files yet. correct data content, incorrect sysx format.

layout increased to fit 18 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800)

continuing sessions at converting from GT-8 version most items are listed, exception of assigns and custom user settings for autoriff & harmonizer.

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active), double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected'). preset patches may not be accessable.

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.

out-going sysex & patch data should hopefully be recognized by GT-10B. internal structure not ready to receive a patch yet.

my wish list: check GT-10B temp buffer when writing/sync patch from editor, that it accepts patch.
               find temp buffer individual write address, the bulk one is too slow for patch tweaking.
	        user patch change works one single click of patch tree item.
		 check connection is working and green led is on (without debug mode)
		  screen capture of returned data from patch request and patch tree name request (debug mode or from midiOX)
		   check realtime edit parameters are correct address and correct data range.
