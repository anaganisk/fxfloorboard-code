*********************GT-FxFloorBoard Preview version: 27 may 2008/revision B*************************

****NOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW VERSION AND MANY FEATURES HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMPLIMENTED, OR SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT.**** 

yet to sort chain structure concept. chain will currently place all FX into channel A path.
try out all the pedals by double or right click on stomp body area, let me know which parameters are incorrect.

saved files will not produce %100 GT10 accurate files yet.
if chain items are moved/dragged, all FX items end up Path A only.
recieved patch data from GT-10 is abled to be saved to file with correct chain data in syx format.
saved files can be re-loaded in to the Editor and passed to the GT-10

layout increased to fit 18 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800)
does this fit on your screen?

continuing sessions at converting from GT-8 version most items are listed,
with exception of assigns and custom user settings for autoriff & harmonizer.

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active),
 double clicking the tree patch item will request a patch transfer from the GT-10.
opening each patch tree bank node  will request patch names (while 'connected'). 
does this work for user & preset patches?

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.

out-going midi & patch data should be recognized by GT-10. 
Editor internal structure now ready to receive a patch.

Any editing done with the 'Chain Order' will result in all fX to Path "A".



****my wish list (things i would like to know, if it works for you): 
		***find temp buffer individual write address,
 		***the bulk address may not be suitable for faster patch tweaking rates.

		***user patch change works correctly with one single click of patch tree item in User and Preset patches.

		***check realtime edit parameters are correct address and correct data range (is the editor tweaking the right GT-10 item).
