GT-FxFloorBoard Preview version: 22 July 2008

NOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW VERSION AND MANY FEATURES HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMPLIMENTED, OR SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT. 
yet to sort chain structure concept. chain will currently place all FX into channel A path.
try out all the pedals by double or right click on stomp body, let me know which parameters are incorrect.

saved files will now produce %100 GT10B accurate files. files can be saved/loaded as syx or mid
the GT10BFxFloorBoard will also open (guitar version) GT10 SMF (.mid) files, but with unpredicable reasults.

layout increased to fit 17 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800)

continuing sessions at converting from GT-10 version most items are listed, exception of assigns and custom user settings for harmonizer.

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active), double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected'). preset patches may not be accessable.

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.

my wish list:  find temp buffer individual write address, the bulk one is too slow for patch tweaking.
	        user patch change works one single click of patch tree item.
		  check realtime edit parameters are correct address and correct data range.
