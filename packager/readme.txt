*********************GT-FxFloorBoard Preview version: 29 August 2008 *************************

****NOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW VERSION AND MANY FEATURES MAY NOT YET BEEN IMPLIMENTED, OR SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT.**** 

a.)  yet to sort chain structure concept. chain will currently place all FX into channel A path.
	try out all the pedals by double or right click on stomp body area, let me know which parameters are incorrect.

b.)  Any editing done with the 'Chain Order' will result in all fX to Path "A" only.
	recieved patch data from GT-10 is able to be saved to file with correct chain data in syx format.
	saved files can be re-loaded in to the Editor and passed to the GT-10

c.)  layout increased to fit 18 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800)
	does this fit on your screen?

d.)  continuing sessions at converting from GT-8 version most items are listed,
	with exception of the assigns and custom user settings for autoriff & harmonizer.

e.)  patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active),
	double clicking the tree patch item will request a patch transfer from the GT-10.
	opening each patch tree bank node  will request patch names (while 'connected'). 

f.)  patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.

g.)  GT-8 patch conversion. Gt-8 patches can be opened and saved as GT-10 patches. SMF file type support added, files compatable 
	with Boss Librarian SMF files (single patch).



****my wish list (things i would like to know, if it works for you): 

		1.)  ***find temp buffer individual write address,
 		     ***the bulk address may not be suitable for faster patch tweaking rates.

		2.)  ***check realtime edit parameters are correct address and correct data range (is the editor tweaking the right GT-10 item).

		3.)  ***check GT-8 patch convertion matches GT-10 equivilent values.
If you find any errors or issues, most likely i don't know about them (i don't have a GT-10 for testing), and i am relying on you to let me know.
