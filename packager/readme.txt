GT-3FxFloorBoard: 
NOTE: THE FxFloorBoard PROJECT HAS ABSORBED A LOT OF MY TIME, 
SO FAR INVESTING OVER 7000 HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 4 YEARS, AND 
TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY, 
BUT SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT,
SO I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS.
