GT-10FxFloorBoard version 20090325: 25 Mar 2009

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DONATE, YOU MAY FREELY USE THIS SOFTWARE, 
 JUST KEEP IN MIND THE 6000 HOURS SPENT OVER 3 YEARS GETTING IT HERE,
  I WOULD LOVE A BEER!!!.

******** USEFUL INFORMATION *************
 
a.) Connect the GT-10 via a USB cable, 
ensure the Boss usb driver software is installed and the SYSTEM>USB>Driver setting on the GT10 is set to 'advanced'.

b.) In most cases the program should select GT 10 device and connect automaticaly, if not, then follow the next two steps.
Start the FxFloorBoard program, for the Menu select Preferences/Midi and select the GT10 midi device for midi input and output.

c.) Select the editor program "Connect" button, it should stay "on" if all connections are correct.

d.) Open the Patch-Tree side panel by clicking your mouse pointer on the 'yellow arrow', 
the Patch-Tree has items which will expand when you click on the [+] symbols.
 When the tree items expand, you will see the patch names appear as the editor requests this information from the GT10.

e.) A single mouse pointer click on the Patch-Tree name will change the GT10 to that selected patch only 
- sound played through the GT10 will have the sound of that patch.
 
f.) A double click on the patch name will load the patch information from the Gt10 into the editor, 
all the patch settings will update the editor GUI.

g.) Any knob turning will change the sound of the effect being adjusted, 
when the desired sound is achieved, you can either save the patch to the GT10 or save the patch to file on disk.

h.) To save the patch to the GT10 press the "write/sync" button. there is a bit of a trick here, 
sometimes the editor is not syncronised to the GT10 so toggle the 'Connect' button, then try the 'Write' button again.

GT10-FxFloorBoard: 
NOTE: THIS IS AN UNPAID PROJECT, SO FAR INVESTING OVER 6000 HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 3 YEARS, 
I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY, 
BUT SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT. 

saved files will now produce %100 GT10 accurate files. files can be saved/loaded as syx or mid
the GT10FxFloorBoard will also open GT10 SMF (.mid) files, and translate GT-8 patch files.

layout increased to fit 18 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800)

This project is a continuing session of evolution.

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active),
 double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected'). preset patches may not be accessable.

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.
