************GT-FxFloorBoard Preview version: 08 October 2008 *************************


****NOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW VERSION AND SOME FEATURES MAY HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMPLIMENTED, 
	OR SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT.****PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS AN ERROR!!  


a.)  yet to sort chain structure concept. chain will currently place all FX into channel A path.
	try out all the pedals by double or right click on stomp body area,
	 
b.)  Any editing done with the 'Chain Order' will result in all fX to Path "A" only (for now).
	recieved patch data from GT-10 is able to be saved to file with correct chain data in syx format.
	saved files can be re-loaded in to the Editor and passed to the GT-10

c.)  layout increased to fit 18 chain events, may be a problem for low screen resolutions.
		 (i use 1280 X 800) does this fit on your screen?

d.)  continuing sessions at building this GT-10 version, most items are listed,
	with exception of the custom and user settings for autoriff & harmonizer.

e.)  patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and 
	(when 'connected' button active), double clicking the tree patch item will request 
	a patch transfer from the GT-10.
	opening each patch tree bank node will request patch names (while 'connected'). 

f.)  patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel (top display with patch name in it).

g.)  GT-8 patch conversion. Gt-8 patches can be opened and saved as GT-10 patches. 
	SMF file type support added,
 	files are compatable with Boss Librarian SMF files (single patch).



****my wish list (things i would like to know, or help needed): 

		1.)  ***find temp buffer individual write address,
 		     ***the bulk address may not be suitable for faster patch tweaking rates.
			even better if i had the GT-10 specification document.

		2.)  ***check realtime edit parameters are to the correct addresses (the knobs do what they should)
			 and correct data range (is the editor tweaking the right GT-10 item).

		3.)  ***check GT-8 patch convertion matches GT-10 equivilent values.
			if anyone has some info on better conversion ideas (i.e. matching preamps correctly)

**IMPORTAINT !! ** If you find any errors or issues, most likely i don't know about them  
		(i don't have a GT-10 or GT-8 for testing),
 		and i am relying on you to let me know. Quite often no-one bothers to let me know

	reply email to <gumtownbassman@yahoo.com> as your information will help with the project progress.
